    <p>  ALL ABOUT ME<br> 
     Hi, My name is Emily Butman. I am 16 and a sophomore in High School. I'm taking a web design class and have made a few websites I am incredibly proud of. From my first website to my newest website you can see the improvement and how much i've learned from this class. This website is a final profile of all my projects.
