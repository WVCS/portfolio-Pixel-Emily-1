<p><br> A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. </p>

<p id="next"><pre> Some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks 
and bars. They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) 
nearby. Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches,are not developed in this 
manner. Wild beaches can be appreciated for their untouched beauty and preserved nature.

The development of the beach as a popular leisure resort from the mid-19th century was the first 
manifestation of what is now the global tourist industry. The first seaside resorts were opened 
in the 18th century for the aristocracy, who began to frequent the seaside as well as the then 
fashionable spa towns, for recreation and health.

Beaches can be popular on warm sunny days. In the Victorian era, many popular beach resorts were 
equipped with bathing machines because even the all-covering beachwear of the period was considered 
immodest. Some beaches are artificial; they are either permanent or temporary. The soothing qualities 
of a beach and the pleasant environment offered to the beachgoer are replicated in artificial beaches, 
such as "beach style" pools with zero-depth entry and wave pools that recreate the natural waves pounding 
upon a beach. In a zero-depth entry pool, the bottom surface slopes gradually from above water down to depth. 
Another approach involves so-called urban beaches, a form of public park becoming common in large cities. 
Urban beaches attempt to mimic natural beaches with fountains that imitate surf and mask city noises, 
and in some cases can be used as a play park.
